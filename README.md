# Nessus Vulnerability Scanner Project Documentation

## Introduction
Hello! My name is Mehedi Hasan, and I'm excited to present my project on using the Nessus vulnerability scanner. In this blog, I will outline the objectives of the project, installing Windows VM and Nessus, the technologies used, challenges faced, and the outcomes achieved.

## Project Overview

### Description
The Nessus Vulnerability Scanner project aimed to deploy and configure Nessus, a widely used vulnerability assessment tool, to identify security vulnerabilities in a network environment.

### Objectives
- Deploy Nessus on a home network environment.
- Configure Nessus to perform regular vulnerability scans.
- Analyze scan results and remediate identified vulnerabilities.

### Technologies Used
- Operating System: Windows 10.
- Virtual Machine: Oracle VM VirtualBox.
- Minimum Hardware requirements for VM: 64 GB Hard Disk space, 4 GB of RAM, 2 or more processors.
- Nessus: Vulnerability scanner used to identify security issues in the network.

## Step-by-Step Documentation

### Step 1: Research and Planning
#### 1.1 Research Nessus
- Explore the official documentation and resources given by Tenable, the company that created Nessus.
- Watch videos on YouTube on how to install Windows 10 on a Virtual machine.

#### 1.2 Plan Deployment
- Assess the hardware and software requirements for deploying Nessus.
- Determine the assets to be scanned.

### Step 2: Setup Environment
#### 2.1 Download Windows Image
- Download the Windows 10 installation media.
- Link: [Windows 10 Download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)

#### 2.2 Install Virtualization Software
- Install Oracle VM VirtualBox to create a virtualized environment for testing Nessus deployment.
- Link: [VirtualBox Download](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

#### 2.3 Configure Virtual Machine
- Create a new virtual machine within VirtualBox.
- Allocate sufficient resources (CPU, RAM, disk space) to the virtual machine.
- Configure network settings to ensure connectivity between the virtual machine and the host system.

### Step 3: Deploy Nessus
#### 3.1 Download and Install Nessus Essential
- Download the Nessus installation package from the Tenable website.
- Register for an Activation code.
- Follow the installation instructions provided by Tenable to install Nessus on the virtual machine.

### Step 4: Perform Vulnerability Scans
#### 4.1 Create a Basic Network scan
- Launch a basic network scan in Nessus to identify open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities on the hosts within the network.

#### 4.2 Monitor Scan Progress
- Monitor the progress of the vulnerability scan within the Nessus interface.
- Review any warnings or errors encountered during the scan.

#### 4.3 Analyze Scan Result
- Analyze the scan results within the Nessus interface.
- Prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity, potential impact, and exploitability.

### Step 5: Remediate Vulnerabilities
#### 5.1 Patch System
- Apply security patches and updates to vulnerable systems and software.
- Implement security controls and best practices to mitigate identified vulnerabilities.

### Challenges Faced
- Configuration Complexity: Configuring Nessus to scan effectively and interpret the results required thorough understanding and experimentation.
- Understanding Scan Results: Interpreting Nessus scan reports and prioritizing vulnerabilities for remediation required careful analysis and research.

### Outcomes Achieved
- Successful Deployment: Nessus was successfully deployed and configured to perform regular vulnerability scans on the home network.
- Identification of Vulnerabilities: Nessus scans identified various security vulnerabilities, including outdated software, weak passwords, and misconfigured services.
- Remediation Efforts: Vulnerabilities were prioritized based on severity and addressed through patching, configuration changes, and other mitigation measures.

## Conclusion
The Nessus Vulnerability Scanner project provided valuable hands-on experience in using a prominent cybersecurity tool to assess and mitigate security risks in a home network environment. This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of vulnerability management principles.
